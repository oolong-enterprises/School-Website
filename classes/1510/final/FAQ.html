              Above is a link to my favorite youtuber for coding: CodeBro. His
              ability to casual explain coding concepts makes learning easy.
              It's like having your friend explain coding to you. He does not go
              beyond basic concepts but provides a great foundation for anyone
              wanting to learn. I have to give credit to everything I know to
              this guy, he really helped me get started.

              Baeldung is a popular online resource for Spring boot, and backend
              development. It is a great online resource for when creating
              spring boot apps. I would not rely on this site to provide the
              best on programming fundanmentals. This site is best to be used
              for a refresher of something already known or to quickly close the
              gaps in something you already kind of know.

              This site I cannot talk too much about from personal experience. I
              have yet to follow through with a course from here but plan to in
              the future. This site provides a "day in the life" style course
              for multiple compainies to let you get a feel for what the
              requirements are to thrive in that position. These courses will
              give you an idea of what you need to focus on in your education.
