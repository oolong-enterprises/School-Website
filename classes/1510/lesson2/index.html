         <p>Welcome to Wild Rescues. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate,
            and release wildlife back into their natural environment. We are a
            nonprofit organization dedicated to helping injured wildlife.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our staff provides around-the-clock care for wildlife in need. We
            also provide long-term care for wildlife that cannot be released back
            into their natural environment.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Will you partner with us? We need caring volunteers to help care
            for our animals. You can also donate, become a member, or become a
            sponsor. Contact us today.</p>
