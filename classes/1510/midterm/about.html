        I am a computer science student in Georgia. I find myself fortunate to
        have something I enjoy studying. Everyday I try to learn something new
        and thought that this webstie would be an appropriate place to share
        what I am learning. It is my hope that people see this and learn with
        me.

          This space is all about curiosity, growth, and the shared love of
          learning. My goal is to build a community of people who enjoy
          exploring the worlds of computers. This will cover everything from
          algorithms and logic to theory and problem-solving.I’m not an expert,
          I am learning right alongside you. Everything here comes straight from
          what I’m actively studying, experimenting with, or trying to
          understand better. Think of it as an open notebook.
